I am a research scientist at LINE Corporation working on machine learning.
In my past life, I was a particle physicist. I received my Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Tokyo in 2017, and my B.Sc. in physics (also from the University of Tokyo) in 2012. Upon graduating, I spent a year at the Technical University of Munich as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie ESR, followed by a stint at NEC Corporation as a researcher.

Research Interests

My recent interests lie in the security and privacy issues of machine learning.
I am also interested in reinforcement learning, statistics, physics and mathematics in general.
